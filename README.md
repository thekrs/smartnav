Smartnav - modern Smartphone Browser Navigation

Smartnav has been created as a shared student project supported by HfTL (Hochschule f√ºr Telekommunikation Leipzig) and Deutsche Telekom AG. Its purpose was to develop a modern navigation concept, the context of use being webbrowser on smartphones. The main goal is to navigate between webpages, holding the smartphone in one hand and using nothing less than a single finger (e.g. thumb). Webpage navigation thus needed to be replaced from the top to the bottom. Three student bachelor thesis evolved the concept using the ISO 9241-210 UX standard, devloping a first, second and third prototype.

This project has been committed under the MIT license.
